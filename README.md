# Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit:

-total number of votes cast

-a complete list of candidates who received votes

-percentage of votes each candidate won

-the winner of the election based on popular vote

The purpose of the challenge assignment was to calculate the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

# Election Audit Summary
From this script one can determine the amount of voters that participated, the amount that voted for a specific candidate, voters per county, winner of the election and county with most voters. The script can be modified to track the voter's state and which state had the largest turnout. Also, it could be modified to looking at some of the demograhics such as age, to get an idea of how voting changes by age.
